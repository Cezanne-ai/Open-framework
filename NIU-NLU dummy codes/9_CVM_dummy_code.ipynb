        "Using NLP question-answering solution to conversational AI can be tricky if we are seeing the conversation for what it really means . The same is with intent-based solutions. Let’s take some examples:\n",

        "In question-answering or chatbots the hypothesis is that the user is addressing a question which is generally built in a positive sentence. In this way the similarity scores will be high with all the available functions and probably will not have a huge impact if you forget to put the question mark. In a conversation, the two pairs of examples have completely different meanings and, even if you use dense layers for embeddings and a very accurate similarity score, you can fail to understand what the user is saying (especially if you don’t have a large corpus). For this reason, we will build a matrix (CVM) to constantly double check the context and the user’s intention. Another way to do it is to check your pipelines and better optimize the tokenizer and sub-word function that you are using. This method can have some effect for huge corpuses and languages like English, however this is not in scope of our paper. Not to mention that if you are using a pre-trained model you need to stick with the model tokenizer and most of the time is out of your hands.\n",
