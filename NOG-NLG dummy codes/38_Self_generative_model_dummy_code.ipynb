Another argument is our belief that this objective is realistic and we can add characteristics to the bot that are specific to humans. In this layer we will extend our enhancements to build the self-generative part of the bot. But not every user will have access to this part as he needs to check some cumulative boxes:\n",

The bot’s mood/behavior will count in NOG answers generation. It can start to have doubts (for example) in its own database answers if the self-generation model provides the necessary incentives.\n",
