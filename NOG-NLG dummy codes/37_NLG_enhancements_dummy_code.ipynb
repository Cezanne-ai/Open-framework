        "To define the personality of a bot (aka general personas) we can use current custom weights (Li et al. 2016) and configure a bot that has conversational capabilities, duplicating in this way the personality of a human by using advanced AI models and methods. It is, however, a debate if the users find a good use of time in speaking with unknown duplicate-humans (that do not impress in terms of character, but mostly in terms of data/information/topics), especially when our objective is the art of conversation. If we take as arguments two characters from movies: E.T. (an extra-terrestrial) and Robocop (a robot with human background) we can argue that humans prefer to have a conversation with E.T. Why is that? For once, maybe people find it more challenging to learn in a conversation and the perspective of talking with a different type of persona (like non-specialist vs expert) is more appealing. Another possible answer is that E.T. is more defined as a conversational character than Robocop and for that reason a specific persona, like a doctor for a conversation related to medical issues, is more likely to be effective. We will go on this path of building a bot that can adapt to the user’s preferred topic.\n",

        "SPCA3 or secondary flow inputs can trigger informal responses/addressing and this can depend on a scoring model.  Once an informal type is triggered, it will not be changed in the interaction with the same user, one of the reasons being the fact that conversation is defined as informal in Webster dictionary and this is one of the objectives of the interaction user-bot. All NOGs (answers/questions, other) related to core inputs will have both formal and informal alternatives in order to adapt to the user vocabulary/addressing. For this task a writer/screenwriter input is needed. Other forms of extracting or generating answers will not be helpful to tackle this issue.\n",

The visual impact can be higher than the one of words in many situations. Avatars will not have an impact on NOG/DPL but can determine the user to take actions if he feels that there is a gap between his state of mind and the bot.\n",
