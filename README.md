We present the Cezanne-ai challenge and we will try to convince you to use our Conversational AI open-framework by using:
1. your own code, 
2. own language, 
3. desired domains,
4. with your existing data (limited or not). 

In order to assist, we give you the following:
1. an architecture that was designed to cover complex objectives in conversational AI (based on the research paper: "Cezanne-ai: a conversational AI open-framework for multi-domains, all the languages and limited data" - Coman et al.,2021) 
2. 50 pipelines described step-by-step (see the dummy code of this repository and the repository: Project-documentation)
3. we will work together with you at the implementation (check out the Cezanne-ai complete repositories. We will try to keep up with you.), 
4. we will share good practices and more efficient implementations from other contributors. 

The framework consists of 3 main layers that can be implemented independently depending on your NLP/Conversational AI tasks:
1. Natural Input Understanding (an extension of NLU) with 2 sub-layers: Machine Education and Machine Learning

[NIU-NLU - Machine Learning architecture.pdf](https://github.com/Cezanne-ai/Open-framework/files/6946315/NIU-NLU.-.Machine.Learning.architecture.pdf)

2. Conversational Policy Learning (an extension of DPL)

3. Natural Output Generation (an extension of NLG)

[NOG-NLG architecture.pdf](https://github.com/Cezanne-ai/Open-framework/files/6946316/NOG-NLG.architecture.pdf)

This three layers have in total 50 pipelines (not all mandatory, but recommended to have a fundamental background and cover also complex objectives in the conversation user-bot)


COMPLYING WITH THE SAFETY ISSUES (related to the AGI implications) PRESENTED IN THE SUBSEQUENT FILE OF THE REPOSITORY IS BINDING!
