        "Our intention is not to build a chit chat bot because we don’t believe chit chat is fundamentally a conversation, on one hand, and on the other the bot should not replace the need of a human presence in our life. \n",
        "\n",
        "At the same time, in every conversation (even with an expert) chit chats or emotional reactions are for sure present. As we are working in a limited datasets environment and in an expertise domain, we will restrict the conversation to two consecutive turns. We’ve already done a cleanup and we are working with short sentences which gives us room for using an intent based model similar to the one from the previous pipeline. For more complex chit chats we will implement sentence-intent that doesn’t need a huge database and is not computational expensive. But also in this case we will limit chit chats in the conversation for the same reasons stated above.\n",
