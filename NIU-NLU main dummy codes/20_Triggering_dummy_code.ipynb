        "In reality, the user’s input can be from the most complex to the simplest one. Even if our architecture is doing all kinds of cleanups and is separating core-inputs from replies or chit chats (if identified), it can be the case that we have in this state a complex and long input that contains Q&As and opinions and long descriptions, and replies, and chit chats… or any combinations of this type of inputs. The fact that we summarize everything in a simple SPCA sentence-intent with one subject +one predicate +one complement + one adjective can be seen as limitative in terms of understanding, even if this summarization is effective. Another issue that might occur is to have an input which is incomprehensible or too simple to find a complete SPCA (and the past interactions didn’t fill in the missing info).\n",
